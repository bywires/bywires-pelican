*Full disclosure: I am not a professional photographer or graphic
designer. 100% hobbyist.*

That said, I do try a fair amount of applications for photo editing and
use a fair amount of the tools they offer for image manipulation.
Consider my thoughts as coming from the perspective of a hobbyist
interested in getting great results (by my standards) with a relatively
small investment in learning new software. I'm also use to working with
[Adobe Lightroom][] and have a Canon Digital Rebel XTi.

Over the past year I've switched from being a lifetime Windows user to
an Ubuntu user. Since the switch I've been desperate for good photo
editing/management software. Previously I'd used Lightroom. I love love
love Lightroom. I had a few options to continue using Lightroom. I tried
going the Windows virtual machine route but I found its responsiveness
to be too slow. I felt like the dual-boot route was too much effort.
File that complain under First-World Problems. I like my desktop setup
and I don't want to reboot my computer just to use one app. I'm lazy.

Finally, I like to not spend money. Free software really appeals me.
This lead me to look for Lightroom alternative that would work with
Ubuntu and ideally would be free.

The post isn't about my application selection process but I did try
[Rawstudio][] and [RawTherapee][] before choosing [Darktable][]. I will
say my preference for Darktable was immediate, though there's a few
things to know to dive in and get to the "learning by using" part.

## Keyboard shortcuts

I like shortcut keys. If you also like shortcut keys and are use to
Lightroom you'll find that some shortcuts are the same but a lot aren't.
If you want to see what the shortcut keys are and even change then to
whatever you like here's how:

[![How to view and modify shortcut keys in Darktable](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-If6bYn4vKlc/TpB_DaWouZI/AAAAAAAAAD0/zQay5K5MpzM/s400/shortcuts.png)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-If6bYn4vKlc/TpB_DaWouZI/AAAAAAAAAD0/zQay5K5MpzM/s1600/shortcuts.png)

I also work on a laptop with a touchpad. You have a lot of zooming
control with your scroll wheel, but I don't have one. Without a scroll
wheel you need to rely on Alt+1. Note, if you hit it twice it zooms in
twice. That is not obvious from just seeing the binding on the shortcuts
tab.

## Plugins

Each type of adjustment you can do to an image is broken into a plugin.
Select a photo and go into Darkroom mode by hitting D. At the bottom
right there is a "more plugins" button. Hover over the plugin to find
out what the plugin means because the icon does not make it obvious at
all. This process annoys me as it takes a fair amount of time just to
know what your options are. Clicking on a plugin will turn the icon
background grey indicating that the plugin has been added the the right
panel. It will be under whatever the plugin's default category is.
Clicking the icon twice will turn the icons background red. This means
the plugin has also been added to the "favorite" category in the right
panel. Click a third time to remove the plugin from the right panel.

Generally I use a few plugins and I use them a lot. My preference was to
only add those plugins to the panel and make them all my favorites. This
makes it a lot easier to use without having to keep switching between
these kinda of poorly defined categories.

## Time to play

With my shortcuts ready and plugins out where I can see this its easy to
play around and make that transition from Lightroom to Darktable.
Darktable doesn't have all the feautres and the easy of use that
Lightoom has, but its still damn good and its free. I am extremely
excited to see how this application will evolve over the next few years.
