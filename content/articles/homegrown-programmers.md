Description: I never had the depth of formal training in college that most of my programmer colleagues have had.  How does someone like me differ from a programmer with that experience?

## Early education

I think when programmers talk about being *homegrown* the distinction they make is usually whether you went to college for programming or not.  I was sort of in the middle.

I went to basically an art college though I got an associate degree of science there.  The college was called Massachusetts Communications College but is now the [New England Institute of Art](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Institute_of_Art).  During my college time I never took courses on data structures or algorithms and never programmed in assembly language.  The math courses there were very light as well.  All seemed fine though.  I was going to be a web designer, not a boring programmer for the rest of my life.  I was into HTML and *Macromedia* Flash and they were fun because I could design visual things.

My parents were just happy I was going to college somewhere because I had taking a disliking to high school and had a bit of a problem with authority.  This isn't to say I was getting setting cars on fire or even in detention a bunch.  I just wasn't happy about being in school and dealing with some teachers I thought were bad.

In high school I was lucky enough to be living somewhere that had three years worth of computer science classes (pretty good for the mid-late 90s).  The courses, as I remember them, were more about writing increasingly difficult programs but not really about theory or formal algorithm education.

I did take the most advanced math courses possible and was pretty much a B student in them despite not putting up not much effort.  To this day I would still say that my high school math teacher for several years, Mr. Watkins, was probably the best teacher I ever had.

I remembered getting excellent grades in high school until a bout a year ago.  My parents had been going through some old file cabinets and came across my high school report cards so they gave them to me.  My vision of being a largely A's and B's student wasn't really so clean cut.  Plenty of C's and even a D.  Lots of notes about my behavior.  I was not going to the principals office, just messing around and being a pain in the ass sometimes.

Before high school I spent time on some old IBM machine with 66MB of RAM, if I remember correctly.  I can't name drop the specific type of computer and even if I did I don't think it would give me that *OG* programmer street cred I yearn for.  I wrote programs in QBasic.  I occasionally tweaked simple DOS game code make them run in some random way I desired.

Before I was old enough to drive I got my hands on Visual Basic at some point and made a simple instant messenger program I used to chat with my friend Chris, another programmer, who lived across town.  Another IM program would have worked just fine, but it was more fun to make one on my own.

## Time and effort

Despite a high school and college experience focusing generally on programming, the formality most people experience in their computer science curriculum wasn't there.  That said, I did leave out one important details of my story so far - I programmed a lot.

I commuted to college only three days a week and the rest of the time I worked a job as a sort of junior MIS guy at a small company that built circuit boards.  I had my own office and computer and I was only 18.  During my time at work I was sure to sneak plenty of programming in.

Meanwhile, every other college kid was out partying when I was at home coding even more.  Did I mention I never, and still don't, drink or do drugs?  If I had a single vice that was becoming a problem... it was programming.  This meant a lot more time for programming during college.  I was up late watching Conan and writing code in my parents basement every night.

In college I entered some design contests and did well, which I believe got me preferential placement in my college's internship program.  My internship turned into a full time job.  I was as a Flash and PHP programmer.

Keep in mind this was after only spending two years on my *associate* degree.  All my friends and my girlfriend were still in college earning their *bachelor* degrees.  This meant that on top of already working professionally, I was still tapping into an abundance of time to myself where I could write code.  More late nights coding with Conan.

At this point it would seem like once my friends graduated college the professional playing field would be level but I'm not sure.  My girlfriend, now wife, teaches children to play piano.  This means she works later in the evening.  Each day I get home and have a few more hours to myself.

I commute into the city each day.  I usually use that time to read about programming, or write about programming like I am right now.

I've had the opportunity to invest a lot of time in my programming career.  I've taken advantage and continue to take advantage of that opportunity and invest it into my career.  This isn't the same as a college degree but possibly as valuable.

## Traps

Oddly the traps that I, as a homegrown programmer, fell into are really traps for all programmers.  Your college degree cannot save you.  I think this is because, simply, professional programming is usually nothing like what you did in college.  The 100-line program you wrote is minuscule compared to the multi-million line monster you're poking at in your professional career.  College didn't answer your real-world question, so you're in search of answers.  The internet, for better or worse, is full of answers (and [solutions](|filename|/articles/problems-vs-solutions-putting-the-cart-before-the-horse.md)).

Back to my story.  Now, if theres two communities you don't want to learn from in the early-mid 2000s its probably the Flash community and the PHP community.  The Flash community was filled with copy/paste programmers who were actually designers.  The PHP community... well just look at PHP.net.  The blind leading the blind leading me.

My programming background probably kept me in the middle of the road in terms of overall quality of my code.  My code might have been a two car accident, but not a ten car pile-up.  Sounds bad, but at my company I think I had sort of a rockstar reputation (A reputation I now despise).  I was given difficult projects and I got them done.  It is only in retrospect that I understood the error of my ways.

There were good role models out there.  Frontend web development was part of my job so I got into the whole *web standards* movement.  A List Apart, Zeldman, Mezzoblue, Simplebits.  They were great sources of information.

Certainly all was not lost, but I still occasionally feel bitter about those years.  I am very happy where I am at now, but it feels a bit like lost time.  The idea that I could be better now, maybe even significantly so, burns me.  This is the risk inexperienced programmers take when learning from the faceless role model, the internet.

## Are we good enough?

The question of where we fail is probably the easiest part of the homegrown programmer experience to describe.  I think its fairly simple.  We know what we do every day for work.  We know what we've invested extra time to learn about.  If those two areas of knowledge don't cover things covered in traditional computer science courses then we don't know them.

If you are hiring for a position that requires skills that are specifically developed in traditional computer science courses then someone having had those courses is a big plus.  There is an expectation of quality.


There is a good chance that you will *not* stumble on the kinds of things you learn in traditional computer science courses at your job.  I don't write sorting algorithms at my job.  I almost never calculate the Big-O notation of anything.  I've never written assembly code.

There are jobs out there that absolutely require these things and if you want one of these jobs its probably a great idea to have that traditional computer science experience.  Still, you can be abundantly useful in many jobs without that knowledge.

Oddly until now, eleven years into my career, I'm just starting to wish maybe I had a little more knowledge of low level system and computer hardware.  I think its mostly our of embarrassment though rather than of actual need.

## Where we shine

College-trained and homegrown programmers are a mixed bag.  I've interviewed people with degrees, asking for six-figure salaries who couldn't code FizzBuzz.  I've seen homegrown programmers that were **terrible**, absolutely terrible.  This I've found to be especially true for homegrown programmers who have grown in total isolation.

If you find a promising homegrown programmer theres a good chance that this person is genuinely enthusiastic about programming.  They figure stuff out for fun.  They like to build things.  They'd be doing this even if it wasn't their job.

I'm not sure you necessarily get that from a degree.  People who go a degree might just want the money the job pays but don't really care about the work.  They might have been safe with the hand holding that college might have provided for them.

## It could have been worse
