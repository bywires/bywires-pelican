Title: About
Status: hidden

My name is not really Colt Daggerfist.  I know thats is probably hard to accept so its OK if you need to sit down or walk away for a minutes while you cool off.  Call your family and tell them you love them then come back when you're ready.

My real name is Bob McKee. I'm a software engineer working in Boston, MA.  I do not have daggers for fists nor do I possess any fist-to-dagger technology.

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn][].

## Why am I doing this?

My programming articles are the the results of long discussions, sometimes arguments, with coworkers and friends.  When it comes to programming, of course you need to *get it done*, but thats not enough.  There is usually more to a project than short term goals.  The way you architect code can have real measurable differences in your ability to grow your product.  This is where interest lies.

Writing allows me to organize my thoughts and share them with others I'm working with.  Hopefully this provides value on my own projects with my own teams.  If by chance it helps you on your projects... you're welcome.  :)
